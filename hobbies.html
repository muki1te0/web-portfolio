                    <h1>Gaming</h1>
                    <p>Playing video games for me is something where you can emphasize any kind of situations, which can help you improve your tactics and strategies. It is not just about being competitive, it is also about those nights you spend with your friends, where you do not care how late it is and how
                        many problems you've got going in your life, but the joy and  the fun you get from playing games together.

                    <h1>Football</h1>
                    <p>Football has been part of my life since I was a kid. From the first moment I've kicked the ball, the game was 
                        my passion. Though I have not played in academies, some even thought that I did. For me, the greatest player that has ever played this game is 
                        definitely Cristiano Ronaldo. I've been watching his games  since I was a kid and I still do. He is the one who has inspired me to play the game of Football and the game of Life.  He is the one who has shown me that with hard work and dedication, you can achieve anything you
                        ever want.  He is the one who has shown me that you can be a legend in your own right.

                    <h1>Music</h1>
                    <p>Music has been a significant part of our lifes since the early ancestry. Sometime it can be too much in our lifes, sure, but not one of us can imagine our lifes without it.
                        Music is a way to express ourselves, to show our feelings, to tell our stories. It can inspire us to achieve our goals, to make us feel better when we are down, to make us feel alive when we  are feeling dead. It can bring us together, it can make us feel like we are part of
                        something bigger than ourselves. It can make us feel like we are home.</p>

                    <h1>Movies</h1>
                    <p>Films, cartoons and serials can be a great way to spend some time. Directors usually spend a great amount of time to create some masterpieces. 
                        They can be a great way to learn something new, to see the world from a different perspective,
                        to feel emotions that we have never felt before. They can be a great way to escape reality,
                        to forget about our problems, to feel like we are in a different world.
